_Updating a visualization through clicks and mouseovers_

[Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/tree/main/examples/week6/week6-2), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week%206%20-%202%3A%20Click%20and%20Hover%20Interaction%20in%20D3%20(Part%201)/1_279viw2s)

1. In the previous notes, we saw how user can supply interactions using D3 event
listeners. Here, we’ll see how to design interactive visualizations that respond
to mouse click and hover events.
2. We’ll work with the movie ratings dataset, which we [previously used](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week2-3.html) when
introducing interactivity in Shiny. The code at these links [1, 2] makes a
static scatterplot for these data, without implementing any interactivity. The scatterplot points are appended using a data bind,
  ```
d3.select("#circles")
    .selectAll("circle")
    .data(data, d => d.Title).enter()
    .append("circle")
    .attrs({
      class: "plain",
      cx: d => scales.x(d.IMDB_Rating),
      cy: d => scales.y(d.Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating),
      fill: d => scales.fill(d.Genre_Group)
    })
  ```
  and the axes are created using `d3.axisLeft` and `d3.axisBottom` applied to the scales,

  ```
  [g element onto which to append the x-axes]
    .call(d3.axisBottom(scales.x).ticks(4))

  [g element onto which to append the y-axes]
    .call(d3.axisLeft(scales.y).ticks(4))
  ```

3.  Let’s first consider how to implement a tooltip using hover events. A
tooltip provides “detailed-on-demand” when the user indicates interest in a
specific elements of a visualization. In our application, we’ll display the
movie name whenever the user hovers over a point in the scatterplot. However, in
principle, any pieces of information could be revealed.

4. To implement this type of interactivity, we first listen for anytime the user
hovers over a movie.
  ```
d3.select("#circles")
    .selectAll("circle")
    .data(data, d => d.Title).enter()
    ... everything the same as before until...
    .on("mouseover", (ev, d) => mouseover(ev, d))
  ```
  The anonymous function `(ev, d) => mouseover(ev, d)` makes sure that we pass
  both properties of the event (`ev`) and the underlying data associated with
  the HTML element under consideration (`d`).

5. Next, we update the text that will contain the movie names. Whenever a hover
event occurs, we will need to (i) change the text of the tooltip and (ii) move
the tooltip to the location of the current point. Note that we have already
created an initial `<div>` element with `id="tooltip"` on the HTML page within
which we can append the movie title.

6. To change the text of the tooltip, we apply `.text()` to the current data
selection. We move the tooltip using a translation of the parent `div` element.
We also change the circle to class `highlighted` so that it appears larger than
the surrounding circles.
  ```
function mouseover(ev, d) {
    let loc = d3.pointer(ev)
    d3.select("#tooltip")
      .attr("transform", `translate(${loc[0]}, ${loc[1]})`)
      .select("text")
      .text(d.Title)

    d3.select(ev.target).attr("class", "highlighted")
}
  ```

7. If we want to display much more information about an item using hover events,
it can be useful to link the hovered item with a table. This can be accomplished
using a mechanism similar to a tooltip. We again track hover events and update
text in a predefined HTML element (a `<table>` in this case). We've given IDs
within the table that will allow us to quickly substitute titles, genres, etc.
within it. In a way, this implementation is even simpler, because we don’t have
to move the text to user’s mouse location.
  ```
function mouseover(ev, d) {
    d3.select("#title").text(d.Title)
    d3.select("#genre").text(d.Genre_Group)
    d3.select("#year").text(d.Release_Date)
    d3.select("#gross").text(d.Worldwide_Gross)
    d3.select(ev.target).attr("class", "highlighted")
}
  ```

9. Next, let’s consider click events. Imagine we wanted to allow select movie
genres by clicking elements of the legend, like in the visualization below,

<iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week6/week6-3/imdb-legend-click.html" width=700 height=600></iframe>

10. To implement this, we’ll use the same array-based logic as in our [earlier
select-input-based gapminder visualization](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week6-1.html). That is, we’ll keep track of an
array of the currently selected genres and will enter and exit datapoints each
time the array is changed.
11. The main differences with what we implemented with the tooltip are that (i)
we need to update the array based on clicks on the rectangles that form the
legend and (ii) when a rectangle is clicked, we need to update not just the
original plot, but also the appearance legend that defines it.
12. To this end, we bind click listeners to the rectangles in the legend. At the
start, all the legend elements are considered selected, and the associated
selection array includes every genre. Whenever a rectangle is clicked, we modify
the array,

  ```
d3.select("#legend .legendCells")
  .selectAll(".cell") // creates selection of the legend rectangles
  .on("click", (ev, d) => toggle_selection(ev, d))

...

function toggle_selection(ev, d) {
  let ix = selected.indexOf(d)
  if (ix == -1) {
    selected.push(d); // adds genre to the selected list
  } else {
    selected.splice(ix, 1) // removes genre from the selected list
  }
  update_view()
}
  ```

13. After the array is modified, we then update the opacity and size of the
scatterplot circles to reflect the selection,

```
function update_view() {
  d3.select("#circles")
    .selectAll("circle")
    .transition()
    .duration(500)
    .attrs({
      opacity: d => selected.indexOf(d.Genre) == -1 ? 0.4 : 1,
      r: d => selected.indexOf(d.Genre) == -1 ? 1 : 2
    })
  ...

```

14. We also change the encoding of the associated legend rectangle and text, to
let the user know that the associated genre has been added / removed from teh selection,

```
d3.select(".legendCells")
  .selectAll("rect")
  .attr("opacity", (d) => selected.indexOf(d) == -1 ? 0.4 : 1)
d3.select(".legendCells")
  .selectAll("text")
  .attr("opacity", (d) => selected.indexOf(d) == -1 ? 0.4 : 1)
```

15. The full implementation of this example can be found here [[1](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/blob/main/examples/week6/week6-3/imdb-legend-click.js),
