_Techniques for referring to DOM elements_

[Code](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat679_code/tree/main/examples/week4/week4-3), [Recording](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Week+4+-+3A+D3+Selections/1_zuu2a5js)

1. In D3, interactive visualizations work by rearranging the appearance and
layout of a web elements (usually SVG objects) in response to user queries. For
example, when a hovers over a circle element in a scatterplot, we might want to
change its color and update a text description accompanying it. D3 accomplishes
these sorts of modifications through a simple but powerful mechanism — the
selection.

2. The two key functions for managing selections are `d3.select()` and
`d3.selectAll()`. Both functions take as arguments strings that referring to
parts of the webpage and return either the first matching tag (`d3.select()`) or
all matching tags (`d3.selectAll()`). There are three ways to refer to parts of
the webpage.
	* Element IDs: Use the `#` symbol followed by the ID of interest to select the item with that ID. For example, `d3.select("#test")` will return a selection for a tag with the an `id='test'` attribute.
	* Element classes: Use a `.` symbol followed by the class of interest to select all items with that class. For example, `d3.select(".highlighted")` will select all elements with class set to `highlight`.
	* Element types: You can also select all objects of a certain type giving the name of that type. For example `d3.select("circle")` will select all circles on the page.

3. We can build nested queries by (1) combining the above strategies, (2)
restricting to elements with specific IDs, and (3) chaining several selections
in sequence. For example, here are three ways to select the set of highlighted
circles on a webpage. Here are examples of each of the three strategies,

    ```
    // strategy (1) to get all circles with class = "higlight."
    d3.selectAll("circle .higlighted")

    // strategy (2) to get all elements with class = "background" within a group element with ID "group1"
    d3.selectAll("#group1 .background")

    // strategy (3) select all text within an element with id "button1"
    d3.select("#button1")
      .selectAll("text")
    ```

4. Note that a selection can be stored in a variable. For example, an equivalent
way of selecting in the third example is to write,
```
let button = d3.select("#button1")
button.selectAll("text")
```

5. Once we have an object in our selection, we can modify its attributes. This
is done using the `attr()` or `attrs()` functions, for one or multiple
attributes, respectively. For example, suppose we want to change the color for
the `#changeme` circle and the width for the path elements (make  them narrow or
wide, depending on the class label) on the DOM below.
```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <head>
		<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
		<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection-multi.v1.min.js"></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="modifySelection.css">
	  </head>
	  <body>
		<svg height=500 width=900>
		  <circle  r=20 cx=50 cy=50 id="changeme" fill="black"/>
		  <g>
	    	<path class="wide" d="M 100 100 L 200 105 L 300 115 L 400 100" />
	    	<path class="wide" d="M 100 200 L 200 205 L 300 215 L 400 200"/>
	    	<path class="narrow" d="M 100 300 L 200 305 L 300 315 L 400 300"/>
	    	<path class="narrow" d="M 100 400 L 200 405 L 300 415 L 400 400"/>
		  </g>
		</svg>
	  </body>
	  <script src="modifySelection.js"></script>
	</html>
```

6. We can accomplish this using the D3 code below, which we called in
`modifySelection.js` at the bottom of the previous page.
```
	d3.select("#changeme")
	  .attr("fill", "#e34234");

	d3.selectAll(".wide")
	  .attr("stroke-width", 20);

	d3.selectAll(".narrow")
	  .attr("stroke-width", 1);
```

7. If you ran the previous example in the browser, the circle already seemed to
be red when you opened the browser. This is because the code executed so
quickly, you didn’t notice the change. We can slow down the change using a
`transition()` (covered more next week).
    ```
    let transition_length = 2000;

    d3.select("#changeme")
      .transition()
      .duration(transition_length)
      .attr("fill", "#e34234");

    d3.selectAll(".wide")
      .transition()
      .duration(transition_length)
      .attr("stroke-width", 20);

    d3.selectAll(".narrow")
      .transition()
      .duration(transition_length)
      .attr("stroke-width", 1);
    ```

9. A special type of modification can be done for text elements. Instead of
changing the attributes of the element, we can change the text that appears
between the open and closing tags using the `.text()` function. The source html
page,

`textChange.html`:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
      <script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection-multi.v1.min.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="textChange.css">
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Change me!</h1>
    </body>
    <script src="textChange.js"></script>
  </html>
  ```

`textChange.js`:

```
d3.select("h1")
  .transition()
  .delay(2000)
  .text("you are changed!!")
```

`textChange.css` (for the fancy font)

```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Pacifico&display=swap');

h1 {
  font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
  font-size: 100px;
}
```
<iframe src="https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_code/examples/week4/week4-3/textChange.html" width=500 height=400></iframe>

10. We can remove all elements in a selection using `.exit()`. For example, this
removes the circle in our first example.
```
	d3.select("#changeme").exit()
```

11. Moreover, we can add new tags below current selections. Conceptually, we
think of the D3 selection as taking us to a specific node in the DOM tree, and
at this position, we append a new leaf. For example, the script below creates a
new path and paragraph element on the first html page.

    ```
    d3.select("g")
      .append("path")
      .attrs({
        class: "wide",
        d: "M 100 0 L 200 5 L 300 15 L 400 0",
        "stroke": "#008b8b"
      })
    ```
    Notice that the `stroke` attribute in the newly appended tag overrules the
    stroke specified by its class (`wide`) in the accompanying css.

12. A common trick is to fade an element in by appending it invisibly and then
transitioning to visible. The first `.attrs()` call below creates an invisible
(`width = 0`) path at the correct location, the second call increases the wide
and sets the class (to make the line purple).
```
	d3.select("g")
	  .append("path")
	  .attrs({
	    "stroke-width": 0,
	    d: "M 100 0 L 200 5 L 300 15 L 400 0",
	  })
	  .transition()
	  .duration(1000)
	  .attrs({
	    "stroke-width": 20,
	    class: "wide"
	  })
  ```
