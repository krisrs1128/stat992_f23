<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A topic is a probability distribution across a collection of words.
If the vocabulary isn’t too large, two appropriate visualization
strategies are,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Faceted barplot: Each facet corresponds to a topic. The height
of each bar corresponds to a given word’s probability within the
topic. The sum of heights across all bars is 1.</li>
      <li>Heatmap: Each row is a topic and each column is a word. The
color of the heatmap cells gives the probability of the word
within the given topic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can construct a faceted barplot using the tidied beta matrix.
We’ve filtered to only words with a probability of at least 0.0003
in at least one topic, but there are still more words than we could
begin to inspect. Nonetheless, it seems that there are words that
have relatively high probability in one topic, but not others.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(topics %&gt;% filter(beta &gt; 3e-4), aes(term, beta)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(topic ~ .) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week12-2/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the heatmap, we need to pivot the topics, so that words appear
along columns. From there, we can use superheatmap. The advantage of
the heatmap is that it takes up less space, and while it obscures
comparisons between word probabilities 1 the main differences of
interest are between low and high probability words.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>topics %&gt;%
  filter(beta &gt; 3e-4) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "term", values_from = "beta", values_fill = 0, names_repair = "unique") %&gt;%
  select(-1) %&gt;%
  superheat(
  pretty.order.cols = TRUE,
  legend = FALSE
  )
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week12-2/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither approach is very satisfactory since there are too many words
for us to effectively label. A workaround is to restrict attention
to a subset of “interesting” words. For example, we could filter to,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Top words overall: We can consider only words whose
probabilities are above some threshold. This is the approach
used in the visualizations above, though the threshold is very
low (there are still too many words to add labels).</li>
      <li>Top words per topic: We can sort the words within each topic in
order from highest to lowest probability, and then keep only the
S largest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most discriminative words: Some words have high probability just
because they are common. They have high probability within each
topic but aren’t actually interesting as far as characterizing the
topics is concerned. Instead, we can focus on words that are common
in some topics but rare in others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can obtain the most probable words using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slice_max</code>
function, after first grouping by topic. Then, we use the same
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reorder_within</code> function from the PCA lectures to reorder words
within each topic. The resulting plot is much more interpretable.
Judging from the words that are common in each topic’s distribution,
we can guess that the topics approximately correspond to: 1 -&gt;
Great Expectations, 2 -&gt; 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, 3 -&gt;
Pride &amp; Prejudice, 4 -&gt; War of the Worlds.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>top_terms &lt;- topics %&gt;%
  group_by(topic) %&gt;%
  slice_max(beta, n = 10) %&gt;%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic))

ggplot(top_terms, aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_y_reordered()

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To visualize discriminative words, we first compute a discrimination
measure for each word and filter to those with the top score. The
filtered results can be used in either faceted barplots or heatmaps.
Specifically, to find the words that discriminate between topics <em>k</em>
and <em>l</em>, we compute
\(D\left(k, l\right) := \beta\_{kw}\log\left(\frac{\beta\_{kw}}{\beta\_{lw}}\right) + \left(\beta\_{lw} - \beta\_{kw}\right)\)
for each word <em>w</em>. By maximizing over all pairs <em>k</em>, <em>l</em>, we can
determine whether the word is discriminative between any pair of
topics. This might seem like a mysterious formula, but it is just a
function that is large when topic <em>k</em> has much larger probability
than topic <em>l</em> (see the figure).</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week12-2/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example heatmap of discriminative words is shown below. This
backs up our interpretation from the figure above. It also has the
advantage that it removes common words (e.g., hand, people, and time
appeared in the plot above) and highlights rarer words that are
specific to individual topics (e.g., names of characters that appear
in only one of the books).</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>discriminative_terms &lt;- topics %&gt;%
  group_by(term) %&gt;%
  mutate(D = discrepancy(beta)) %&gt;%

  slice_max(D, n = 200) %&gt;%
  mutate(term = fct_reorder(term, -D))

discriminative_terms %&gt;%
  select(-D) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "topic", values_from = "beta") %&gt;%
  column_to_rownames("term") %&gt;%
  superheat(
    pretty.order.rows = TRUE,
    left.label.size = 1.5,
    left.label.text.size = 3,
    bottom.label.size = 0.05,
    legend = FALSE
  )

    <p>Besides the topics, it is useful to study the topic proportions for
each chapter. One compact approach is to use a boxplot. The result
below suggest that each chapter is very definitely assigned to one
of the four topics, except for chapters from Great Expectations.
Therefore, while the model had the flexibility to learn more complex
mixtures, it decided that a clustering structure made the most sense
for Pride &amp; Prejudice, War of the Worlds, and 20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>memberships &lt;- memberships %&gt;%
  mutate(
book = str_extract(document, "[^_]+"),
topic = factor(topic)
  )

ggplot(memberships, aes(topic, gamma)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~book)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week12-2/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boxplot considers the collection of documents in aggregate. If
we want to avoid aggregation and visualize individual documents, we
can use a heatmap or jittered scatterplot. These approaches are
useful because heatmap cells and individual points can be drawn
relatively small — anything requiring more space would become
unwieldy as the number of documents grows. For example, the plot
below shows that chapter 119 of Great Expectations has unusually
high membership in Topic 2 and low membership in topic 3.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ggplot(memberships, aes(topic, gamma, col = book)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(h = 0.05, w = 0.3)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = document), size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~ book) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week12-2/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, we can use a “structure” plot. This is a type of
stacked barplot where the colors of each bar corresponds to a topic.
We’ve sorted the documents using the result of a hierarchical
clustering on their proportion vectors. The takeaways here are
similar to those in the scatterplot above.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gamma &lt;- memberships %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "topic", values_from = "gamma")
hclust_result &lt;- hclust(dist(gamma[, 3:6]))
document_order &lt;- gamma$document[hclust_result$order]
memberships &lt;- memberships %&gt;%
  mutate(document = factor(document, levels = document_order))
ggplot(memberships, aes(gamma, document, fill = topic, col = topic)) +
  geom_col(position = position_stack()) +
  facet_grid(book ~ ., scales = "free", space = "free") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
