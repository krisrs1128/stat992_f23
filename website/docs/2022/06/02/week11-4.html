      <p><em>Guiding dimensionality reduction through user inputs</em></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the academic literature, dimensionality reduction methods are
usually presented with an algorithmic focus. However, in practice,
there is often a strong human element in the application of these
methods, since their value lies in the qualitative interpretations
that they support. With this in mind, we should try to understand
how interactivity can be used in the dimensionality reduction
context. Naturally, all of the techniques we’ve studied in this
class for interacting with scatterplots (e.g., dynamic linking)
apply to dimensionality reduction results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, here is an interactive version of the UMAP from the
example in the previous notes. A brush can be used to retrieve
sample details.</p>

</iframe>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A less obvious idea is that interactivity can guide the application
or refinement of the dimensionality reduction itself. For example,
it can be used to filter the data that are input to the
dimensionality reduction. More generally, the input data may be the
result of a complex preprocessing pipeline, and parameters of that
pipeline can be interactively adjusted.</p>

</p>

    <p>For example, in dimensionality reduction of temporal data, we may
first want to compute a sliding window average over time, and the
widths of the windows can be chosen interactively. For each choice
of window width, the dimensionality reduction scatterplot can be
regenerated.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some systems allow users to interactively label observations into
classes — this is especially common when the ultimate goal of the
data science system is to support classification. Certain
dimensionality reduction methods (though not the ones we discussed
in class) can incorporate these class labels, and so can be
recomputed each time the user labels a subset of points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than interacting with the observations, we can interact with
the features. For example, the PCA loadings define derived features.
By interactively adjusting the values of these loadings, we can
examine how the dimensionality reduction would change when the
derived features are manually refined.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s also possible to interactively select between several competing
dimensionality reduction methods. This can be done using a measure
of dimensionality reduction quality, like the effectiveness with
which known clusters are separated. However, among all the types of
interactivity for dimensionality reduction techniques, this is among
the rarest that is implemented in practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most applications, users are expected to interact either directly
with the visualization (selecting or marking points) or via external
UI inputs. It’s also possible to have the interaction through
external program controls or other more novel inputs (like speech,
gestures, multitouch commands on tablets, …). Here is a breakdown of
some example interaction strategies, originally from the _Visual
Interaction with Dimensionality Reduction” survey paper.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stepping back, it’s helpful to view visualization and data science
algorithms holistically. In applications where interpretation and
discovery are important, algorithms and interaction can work
together to support complex reasoning.</p>
