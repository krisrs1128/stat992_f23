      <p><em>When is dimensionality reduction helpful?</em></p>

    <p>High-dimensional data are data where many features are collected for
each observation. These tend to be wide datasets with many columns.
The name comes from the fact that each row of the dataset can be
viewed as a vector in a high-dimensional space (one dimension for
each feature). These data are common in modern applications,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each cell in a genomics dataset might have measurements for
hundreds of molecules.</li>
      <li>Each survey respondent might provide answers to dozens of
questions.</li>
      <li>Each image might have several thousand pixels.</li>
      <li>Each document might have counts across several thousand relevant
words.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, consider the Metropolitan Museum of Art dataset, which
contains images of many artworks. Abstractly, each artwork is a
high-dimensional object, containing pixel intensities across many
pixels. But it is reasonable to derive a feature based on the
average brightness.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week11-1/metropolitan-1.png" alt="An arrangement of artworks according to their average pixel brightness, as given in the _The Beginner's Guide to Dimensionality Reduction_." width="484" /></p>
    <p class="caption">

brightness, as given in the *The Beginner’s Guide to Dimensionality
Reduction*.

    <p>In general, manual feature construction can be difficult.
Algorithmic approaches try streamline the process of generating
these maps by optimizing some more generic criterion. Different
algorithms use different criteria, which we will review in the next
couple of lectures.</p>

    <p><img src="/stat679_notes/assets/week11-1/metropolitan-2.gif" alt="The dimensionality reduction algorithm in this animation converts a large number of raw features into a position on a one-dimensional axis defined by average pixel brightness. In general, we might reduce to dimensions other than 1D, and we will often want to define features tailored to the dataset at hand." /></p>

    <p>Informally, the goal of dimensionality reduction techniques is to
produce a low-dimensional “atlas” relating members of a collection
of complex objects. Samples that are similar to one another in the
high-dimensional space should be placed near one another in the
low-dimensional view. For example, we might want to make an atlas of
artworks, with similar styles and historical periods being placed
near to one another.</p>
