      <p><em>Nonlinear dimensionality reduction with UMAP</em></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nonlinear dimension reduction methods can give a more faithful
representation than PCA when the data don’t lie on a low-dimensional
linear subspace. For example, suppose the data were shaped like
this. There is no one-dimensional line through these data that
separate the groups well. We will need an alternative approach to
reducing dimensionality if we want to preserve nonlinear structure.</p>

  <li>
    <p>From a high-level, the intuition behind UMAP is to (a) build a graph
joining nearby neighbors in the original high-dimensional space, and
then (b) layout the graph in a lower-dimensional space. For example,
consider the 2-dimensional sine wave below. If we build a graph, we
can try to layout the resulting nodes and edges on a 1-dimensional
line in a way that approximately preserves the ordering.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A natural way to build a graph is to join each node to its <em>K</em>
closest neighbors. The choice of <em>K</em> will influence the final
reduction, and it is treated as a hyperparameter of UMAP. Larger
values of <em>K</em> prioritize preservation of global structure, while
smaller <em>K</em> will better reflect local differences. This property is
not obvious a priori, but is suggested by the simulations described
in the reading.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One detail in the graph construction: In UMAP, the edges are
assigned weights depending on the distance they span, normalized by
the distance to the closest neighbor. Neighbors that are close,
relative to the nearest neighbors, are assigned higher weights than
those that are far away, and points that are linked by high weight
edges are pulled together with larger force in the final graph
layout. This is what the authors mean by using a ``fuzzy’’ nearest
neighbor graph. The fuzziness allows the algorithm to distinguish
neighbors that are very close from those that are far, even though
they all lie within a <em>K</em>-nearest-neighborhood.</p>

</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the graph is constructed, there is the question of how the
graph layout should proceed. UMAP uses a variant of force-directed
layout, and the global strength of the springs is another
hyperparameter. Lower tension on the springs allow the points to
spread out more loosely, higher tension forces points closer
together. This is a second hyperparameter of UMAP.</p>

  <li>
    <p>In R, we can implement this using almost the same code as we used
for PCA. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">step_umap</code> command is available through the embed
package.</p>

  <li>
    <p>We can summarize the properties of UMAP,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Global or local structure: The number of nearest neighbors K
used during graph construction can be used modulate the emphasis
of global vs. local structure.</li>
      <li>Nonlinear: UMAP can reflect nonlinear structure in
high-dimensions.</li>
      <li>No interpretable features: UMAP only returns the map between
points, and there is no analog of components to describe how the
original features were used to construct the map.</li>
      <li>Slower: While UMAP is much faster than comparable nonlinear
dimensionality reduction algorithms, it is still slower than
linear approaches.</li>
      <li>Nondeterministic: The output from UMAP can change from run to
run, due to randomness in the graph layout step. If exact
reproducibility is required, a random seed should be set.</li>
    </ul>
